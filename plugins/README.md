PLUGINS
=======

One great feature of the GSBOT is its plugins system.

When you create a new broadcast using the command line tool, only the '[default](plugins/default)' plugin is enabled. It constitutes a set of functions useful for any shared broadcast.


However, this repository contains some plugins created by the community. They can add all kinds of new functionality to the bot, from a stat module, to some scheduled shoutouts, and anything you could imagine.Make sure to read carefully the plugin description before enabling it.

If there is no plugin that fits your needs, feel free to create your own!

NOTES
-----

The official support for the bot only includes the 'default' plugin. You may contact the author of the plugin by creating an issue and tagging that person.

In order for a pull request to be accepted, your plugin must:
* Comply to the guideline.
* Not contain any malicious code.
* Be useful for a user out of the box (other's users shouldn't need to touch a single line of code to make the plugin work).
* Be named appropriately
