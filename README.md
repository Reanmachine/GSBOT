Grooveshark just updated their service, the bot is moving from a webbrowser extension to a standalone nodejs app. 

Due to the complete refactoring, **this is a BETA version, expect bug, crash, and other annoyances**. If you want to create your own plugins, please open a ticket so we can discuss the easier way to implement it.
